__Usage__
High-performance frequency mixer. RF/IF ports are 50Ω. Strongly recommend Oshpark PCB fabrication to preserve stripline impedance.

Direct usage is not recommended. Rather, this circuit should be directly integrated into a complete radio PCB.

Vcc should be 6.5V.

LO input is intended to be a 40Ω 3.3V CMOS clock (ie. Si514/Si570), and should not exceed Vcc on the secondary (high-impedance) side of the step-up ADTT4-1 4:1 balun transformer. Ommitting R1, the LO termination resistor, may or may not affect performance.

__Design__
Design goal is to achieve a maximum dynamic range mixer with no fine tuning.

Mixer based on research by PA3AKE and G3OOU, as well as the SoftRock Ensemble RX.

Stripline 14.7423mil wide has been used to achieve characteristic impedance close to 50 ohms, given a dielectric constant of 3.66 for the FR408 substrate, 6.7mil thick dielectric, and 1.4mil thick copper. These specifications are derived from Oshpark's 4-layer board stackup.

Extensive common-mode rejection techniques are employed, including RF transformer common-mode chokes, isolated ground planes, and buried signal transmission lines under heavy ground planes.

USA companies provide all parts in these schematics.
